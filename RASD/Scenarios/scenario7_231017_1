Scenario 7: (covered cases: carbon footprint, weather conditions)
Paolo is a student living in Milan. He is already registered to the app and has a bike on his own, which is saved in the personal settings of his account.\\
He has an exam this afternoon and he creates it as a meeting with high priority. As Paolo is really concerned with environmental issues, he sets the "Minimize carbon footprint" option.\\
The best choice, according to his choice and the distance of the university, would be the bike; however it is a very rainy day and the system excludes this possibility, due to the bad weather conditions.
The proposed route is therefore the bus. Paolo selects this route and reaches his university in time to study a little bit before the exam.
