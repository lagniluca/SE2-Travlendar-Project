\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
\subsection{Description of the given problem}
Travlendar+ is a management service-to-be that allows users to plan their meetings and make  arranged routes to their destinations. The given problem is to design, implement and test a calendar-based application for it.
A user can create an appointment on a certain date, time and reachable location (over a region) using GPS localization. The appointment can be held either at a specific time or in a time interval and last for a certain time period. An appointment can be repeated regularly over time (lunch, gym, taking children to a kindergarten). A User can travel with someone else and can meet or leave them during the day.

User has an opportunity to use his own travel means and a pass for public transports. According to this the travel means can be grouped in three categories: public, shared or private.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Public transport: include trains, buses, underground, taxis, trains. They have to be taken in their designated stops. User must have a valid ticket in order to take any public transport but taxis (do not require tickets). Otherwise a User must have an availability to buy a ticket, update his/her pass or pay for a taxi trip on-line with his/her credit card;
	\item Shared travel means: include car and bike. They are located in specific places and require to make a reservation for using them;
	\item Private travel means: vehicles owned by the User. They can be cars, bikes, motorcycles. Walking is also a private travel means.
\end{itemize}

Weather conditions can change during the day. A User can find out the actual information about the latest weather conditions during his/her planned meeting and choose more comfortable way to reach his/her final destination.

In the morning or on demand a User can send a request about the schedule of his/her daily appointments by some criteria of evaluation such as assigned priority and satisfaction of constraints imposed by the User. When a new appointment is made, a User creates a new item in the application and saves it in the appointment list. User can require the application rescheduling meetings because of unexpected changes (e.g. cancelled or postponed meeting). User always know how long it takes to get his/her final destination. 

A green and ecological approach is the core of Travlendar+ business and according to this a lot of details have been defined:  the application firstly suggests the most ecological path to a User (e.g. path with walking or using public transport means, a bike instead of a car) to minimize carbon footprint. 
Ultimately, the system will have to be easy-to-use, reliable and highly scalable to fit perfectly  with the mutable context in which it will be planned to be used.


\subsection{World phenomena}

\begin{itemize}
	\item User arranges a new meeting;
	\item User meets another person;
	\item User leaves another person:
	\item User has private travel means and/or passes for public transportation;
	\item User gets up;
	\item User moves;
	\item Shared travel mean moves;
	\item User's pass expires; 
	\item There are available various travel means.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Shared phenomena}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Allocation of a  shared transport;
	\item User's allocation;
	\item Shared travel mean is not available;
	\item Weather condition changes;
	\item Public transport reaches its final stop;
	\item Public transports are not available due to a strike or an accident;
	\item User requires a timetable of the necessary public transport route;
	\item User inserts a new appointment into the calendar;
	\item User buys a ticket or a pass for the necessary public transport;
	\item User requires booking his/her ride.	 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Machine phenomena}

\end{itemize}

\section{User Characteristics}
\subsection{Actors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item (A01): User - a general actor who uses the application.
		\item (A02): Client - a registered user.
		\item (A03): Visitor - a user who is not registered yet.
	\item (A04): Technical Support - an actor who aids the user in case of techical problems with the app.
	\item (A05): [External companies]
\end{itemize}

We have done a distinction between Client and Visitor because we think that , one day, 
it will be usefull , for our application, to evolved and a special treatment for making the 
user fidelity stronger will be desiderable or required.

Anyway, at this stage , there are no difference in features between a visitor and a client. 
So, if it is not necessary, we will refer to them as users.

\subsection{Agents}

The purpose of this application is to aim clients for short travels, so we limits our travel means:

\begin{itemize}

\item (M01): Feet 
\item (M02): Personal bike 
\item (M03): Personal car
\item (M04): Other autonomous personal means of transport
\item (M05): Other non autonomous personal means of transport
\item (M06): Bike provided by a bike sharing provider, if available
\item (M07): Car provided by a car sharing provider, if available
\item (M08): Other non autonomous transport
\item (M09): Other autonomous transport
\item (M10): Train
\item (M11): Tram
\item (M12): Bus 
\item (M13): Taxi
\item (M14): Metro (for Milan, Rome, Turin and Naples)
\item (M15): Boat (for cities like Venice).

\end{itemize}

We can exclude planes, because of the nature of the travels considered.\\

Other autonomous personal means of transport can be anything that has an engine like motorcycles , quad, segway and so on.

Other non autonomous personal means of transport can be anything, used for moving from one place to another, that hasn't an engine like rollerblade, skateboards and so on.

Other non autonomous means of transport can be tandems. 

Other autonomous means of transport can be rented vehicles like motorcycles , cars not provided by a carsharing but also hichkicking and so on.

For all the "other [...] transport" we don't provide a specialized definition, we only focus on maximum speed, euro class and possible special access/limitations (like for vehicles disposed for disable people). We assume mandatory (the client must provided this kind of information if he intended to use this kind of vehicles), if the user want to use this application correctly, and we leave the possibility to add information about other important things of that travel mean by the user himself.


\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}

\item (S01): Owning company - obviously, this company is a stakeholder.
\item (S02): External company - A general external company that provides means of transport or services. (Google, ATM, Mobike).

\end{itemize}

We can assume that another possible stakeholder could be the city (or region) government itself because the local community can be interested in investing resources for reducing traffic and pollution.\\

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{Scenarios}
In this section we provide some possible situations that can occours during the use of our application.

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc01) }
Albert has an important appointment in Milan. 
This meeting could provide a new customer to his company, so he has to do a good impession, arriving in time.\\
He arrived by train at 8.00 in the morning and the meeting is scheduled for 11.15, there is a lot of time, because 
the company is near the station, but he doesn't know where to go.\\
He is already a client of our app, because he travels a lot for work.\\
He sets up the initial point (using his current position) and the arrival point.\\
The path is very short, and there are no car/bike sharing near with him (the application doesn't provide them), but he doesn't go by foot not to sweat,
so he disable foot option and decide to use the bus, which come closer to his arrival.\\
The application provides a link connection to the ATM site for reserving a ticket, and he uses it.
The total time of the travel is 30 minutes so he has to decide what to do during this time interval.
He has seen that there is a library near the company, it's only 5 minutes by foot, so he decides to set a break here that longs 3h, for review his presentation,
but this break requires too much time and, because of this, the software doesn't allow him, so he has to change it in only 2h.
There are no problems during the path and arrived at the library at 8.40.\\
At 10.40 the alarm related to the break rings, so he decides to leave the library and go to the company building. 
Here he disables the app.

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc02) }
Brigitte is a french tourist who decided to visit Venice. She's at the airport right now and she wants to go to her hotel .\\
This is her first time in Italy so she looks in the play store and find out our app.
She doesn't travel very often , so she decides to use the app as a visitor.\\
First of all, she decides just to get the hotel to leave her luggage.
She sets the application, she only chooses public and shared means of transport. 
She decides to use the bus (for the first part of the journey) to reach the hotel and  it takes only 5 minutes by foot. 
She doesn't set any breaks and it requires a path time of 1h.\\
After she has arrived to the hotel, she decided to visit Piazza San Marco, Palazzo Ducale and Ponte di Rialto in her first day.
She has all the day, but she has to come back to the hotel before 2 A.M.\\
Her first place is Piazza San Marco, which is not so distant from her hotel , so she sets the walking option. 
After she has been here, she sets Palazzo Ducale as the next place and a break of 1.30h for enjoying Piazza San Marco.\\
For Palazzo Ducale there are only four means of transport suitable: walking, car sharing, bike sharing and taxis, because it is a bus strike at that moment. 
She decides to take a taxi,but she doesn't call it because she has enough time,  she wants to relax and takes it easy , she's on holiday after all.\\
After 1.30h the alarm rings, but she has changed her mind  and decided to go there by the bike sharing (because she take a Cappuccino and a Croissan at piazza San Marco and she had to paid 20 euro, that's why she has decided to save money). 
Our application provides her an external link to the Mobike application that shows her the nearest available bike and the way how to unlock it.
She does and goes to Palazzo Ducale.\\
She arrived at 4.00 and decides to set a journey to ponte di Rialto via Gondola (using a boat) , the last available will be at 5.15, so she sets the required time to arrive here on bike and a 30 minute break.\\
But her break requires too much time, and she ignores the application notification.
So, now, she has to arrive there in only 10 minutes , the only possible solution is the taxi and she has to do so.\\
Our application doesn't has a direct access to the API of the taxi provider because there has not been released yet but she can call a taxi using our link to the taxi site and then, using the contact provided, call for a taxi reservation. She does so.\\
She buys the ticket for the boat directly there. 
The tour finishes at 18.30.\\
Then she decides to go to a Disco and sets the arrival time at 23.00.
Only taxis, bike sharing and car sharing are available, but as she wants to use a car (she has to pass through a risk zone) she decides to rent a car.\\
After the Disco she decides to eat someting and visit some shops there. 
She delays her departure and the application informs her that there are no available solutions for arriving in time. She only exits from the app.\\
Then , at 1.30 she sets the path to come back to the hotel without any breaks and selects the car as a mean of tranport. Once she arrives at the hotel , she disables the app.\\

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc03) }
Carl has to marry , her future wife (Denise) has decided the place where to do so.\\
She is from Mantova and he is from Sicily (like all his parents and friends).\\
Denise lived in Mantova since she was 23 and then she decided to move to Sicily where she met Carl, her family is in Mantova and, sometimes she goes to find them (and of course knows the city) but Carl has never been there.
So, Carl is in big troubles because he only has 30 minutes to reach Santuario della Beata vergine delle Grazie from the Mantova train station and, of course, he has to find a way to carry also all his family and friends (which are , at last 30).
So he is in a hurry and decides to download the app and use it as a visitor.\\
He sets the journey without breaks and there are no public possible solutions that can be adapted, and there is only one possible proprietary solution that provide API : to call a taxi.\\
This is a problem because for carrying all his parents and friends it will require at least 5 taxis.\\
But there is another option, provided by an external company , which rent bus.\\
The company doesn't provide any api, but it provides a link for their site in which there are all their contacts.\\
This is the way he used our app, we don't know if he can accomplish his mission , we can suppose so by the fact that he doesn't used the app anymore for that day.\\
We pray for you Carl!\\

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc04)}
Peter is a user of Travlendar+ app. He and his family with two children arranged with their friends about the trip to Gardaland park in advance and decided to put it in the app’s calendar. One of the most convenient way to travel with children is using a car, that’s why one of Peter’s user preferences is a car option. It is Sunday, there is no traffic jams anywhere. So the app suggests a car option as one of the travel means to reach the location of the meeting. Peter, surely, chooses this option. It is the first time of using this option and then the app asks him if he has his own car. Peter does and accepts this option. The app asks to allow to remember his decision for the next trips and whishes him a nice day!

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc05)}
Chiara has just got to hear about a very interesting exhibition in Palazzo Reale dedicated to her favorite painter Toulouse-Lautrec and she is looking forward to visiting it. She decides not to postpone the visit and wants to go there instantly. She opens Travlendar+ app and creates an appointment. Unfortunately, she is in Biccoca, it is 18:55 now but Palazzo Reale closes at 7 pm.   The app warns Chiara that she cannot get to the exhibition because of unreachable time. Chiara postpones the visiting for tomorrow.

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc06)}
Diana would like to go to the city center to walk with her boyfriend. Diana has already used Travlendar+ and creates the appointment. The application suggests her different ways to reach her destination. Diana loves bicycling and she has enough time before the date. She chooses the bike way. The application asks her if she has her own bike. Unfortunately, Diana has just moved into Milan and has not had her own bike yet. She answers “No” and the app suggests her the bike-sharing option. It is exactly what she needs and she chooses it. 

However, the bike-sharing service site with API does not work now. The app notifies the Technical support about the problem. The application shows a message with apologising to Diana and asking her a few minute waiting. The Technical support fixes the problem with redirecting to the page with a link to another bike-sharing service without open API.  As soon as the problem is fixed Diana gets a notification that she is able to reserve a bike with this link. Diana is happy, but her wishing to have her own bike has increased.

\subsubsection{Scenario (Sc07)}
Paolo is a student living in Milan. He is already registered to the app and has a bike on his own, which is saved in the personal settings of his account.\\
He has an exam this afternoon and he creates it as a meeting with high priority. As Paolo is really concerned with environmental issues, he sets the "Minimize carbon footprint" option.\\
The best choice, according to his preferances and the distance of the university, would be the bike; however it is a very rainy day and the system excludes this possibility, due to the bad weather conditions.
The proposed route is therefore the bus. Paolo selects this route and reaches his university in time to study a little bit before the exam.
